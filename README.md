# Kattis_Basic_Programming_2_-medium-

You think you can code?
This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.
You are given two integers 𝑁 and 𝑡; and then an array 𝐴 of 𝑁 integers (0-based indexing).
Based on the value of 𝑡, you will perform an action on 𝐴.

𝑡: Action Needed

1: Print “Yes” if there are two integers 𝑥∈𝐴
  and 𝑦∈𝐴 such that 𝑥≠𝑦 and 𝑥+𝑦=7777,
  or “No” otherwise (without the quotes)

2: Print “Unique” if all integers in 𝐴 are different;
  	or print “Contains duplicate” otherwise (without the quotes)

3: Find and print the integer that appears >𝑁2
  times in 𝐴; or print −1 if such integer cannot be found

4: Find and print the median integer of 𝐴
  if 𝑁 is odd; or print both median integers of 𝐴
  if 𝑁 is even (separate them with a single space)

5: Print integers in 𝐴
  that fall between a range [100…999] in sorted order;
  (print a single space between two integers)
